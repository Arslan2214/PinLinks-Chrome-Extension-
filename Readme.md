## About Project

Our project, PinLinks, is a Chrome extension designed for easy management of web links. It allows users to save, organize, and easily navigate to different web links directly from their Chrome browser. Users can categorize their saved links into different collections based on genre or type, providing a highly organized and user-friendly interface for managing their favorite websites.
